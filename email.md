## Code Used for Analysis

### Data Loading and Filtering
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('usage_data.csv')
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Filtering data for January 2023
january_2023_data = df[(df['Date'] >= '2023-01-01') & (df['Date'] <= '2023-01-31')]

# Summarizing total time spent
january_total_time = january_2023_data['Time spent'].sum()
print(january_total_time)
```

### Monthly Trend Visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Aggregating data by month
df['YearMonth'] = df['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_time_spent = df.groupby('YearMonth')['Time spent'].sum().reset_index()

# Plotting the trend
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_time_spent['YearMonth'].astype(str), monthly_time_spent['Time spent'], marker='o', label='Total Time Spent')
plt.axvline(x='2023-01', color='red', linestyle='--', label='January 2023')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.xlabel('Month-Year')
plt.ylabel('Total Time Spent')
plt.title('Monthly Total Time Spent Trend')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
