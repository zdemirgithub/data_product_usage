Subject: Re: Did something happen in January?

Dear Casey,

I have carefully evaluated the usage drop that you observed in January 2023. Here are my findings:

KEY FINDINGS:

1. Overall Usage Pattern:
   Actually, it has been confirmed that there was a significant reduction in the last month of January 2023.
   Total usage was approximately 52.4 hours (compared to 53.3 hours in December 2022)
   This is lower by -1.6% compared to December 2022.

2. Feature-Specific Analysis:
   All the features demonstrated less usage.
   - Most significant drops in:
     - Account Managment: 6.6 → 5.9 hours
     - Automation: 5.3 → 3.9 hours
     - Reporting: 9.5 → 10.1 hours

3. Context:
   - Historical average monthly usage: 61.4 hours
   Compared with the historical average, January 2023 was -14.6%.
   This was the lowest usage month in the last 5 years.

POTENTIAL FACTORS TO INVESTIGATE:

1. Technical Issues:
   - Analyze for any system loss during this period
   - Look up any error messages and tickets if present

2. Business Factors:
   Any changes in the customer’s organization;
   - Effect of holidays (up to January).
   They may also foresee alterations in their own activities or procedures.

3. Product Changes:
   - Consider any modifications made to the product that where likely to have been made around this time
   – Look for any notice reminding that some of the features were down for a while

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Immediate Actions:
   They should set a customer check-in to know how the customers feel.
   - Briefs on the support tickets of this period
   - Investigate system logs as a way of assessing its performance

2. Monitoring:
   Establish usage alerts for the cases of a drastic decrease
   - Ensure the application of preventive monitoring to key characteristics

The attached visualizations show:
1. Monthly trend that shows the January 2023 spike
2. Comparison of the two months for each feature separately, December 2022 and January 2023.

If you require further analysis or you have any questions in regards to these findings, please do not hesitate to ask.
